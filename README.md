# Micro-Nanofabrication-and-Instrumentation-Laboratory

## Overview
This repository contains my work, documentation, and reflections on two major projects, Chip 0 and Chip 1, undertaken during the ELEC463 Nanofabrication course. These projects provided a comprehensive exposure to both passive and active silicon photonic devices.
